## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
- https://www.w3schools.com/

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
- A challenge I encountered in creating this submission was when trying 
to import the gif files that had recorded my project’s implemented 
required features. I was unfamiliar with the way around and the 
features of glitch.com. I thought it was as simple as clicking the 
Files button on the far left and then uploading the gif file where I 
can then link it in my README.md. Just as I expected, there was a pop up 
when you clicked the Files button which is where you can upload your 
files but unfortunately when I tried to upload my gif files, nothing 
happened. I tried another time just to make sure and still nothing. 
I decided to look at other tabs which are Settings and Assets but I 
still didn’t have any clue. So I decided to search on google on how to 
upload a gif file on glitch.com and I was able to find what I was 
looking for. Someone had asked a somewhat similar question, on 
support.glitch.com, to what I have but instead of a gif file, it was an 
image file. Someone said to open up the project assets and drag the file 
from the desktop into it. So I went back into the Assets tab and dragged 
my gif file into it and it looks like it works. To make sure that it 
works, I went into README.md and typed the name of my gif file with the 
.gif behind it but it did not work. I went back to the Assets tab, 
clicked on my gif files, and then a pop up box appeared with… a URL. 
I believed that was what I needed, copied it then proceeded to README.md, 
and pasted the link there. Guess what? The gif was displayed!

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- I was wondering how crazy and creative I can get with web development 
if I were to learn more knowledge and techniques over time from HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript. Are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript the only front end 
languages? How challenging would becoming a web developer be? What is 
the most difficult part of web development? What are the roles of web 
development in the technical world? Is the front end more important 
than the back end? How do the two interact with each other? What are 
the essential things you need to be fluent in web development? Why is 
eb development important? And finally, how do I debug or test for bugs?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would definitely 
try out the other optional features that were listed such as, speeding 
up the clue playback on each turn to make the game harder as it goes on, 
randomly generating the pattern instead of a fixed pattern, allowing the 
user to make 2 mistakes before they lose the game, adding images to the 
game buttons when clicked, or use alternative sound effects, and making the 
game even harder by limiting how much time the player has to make their 
guesses. Additionally, I can further stylize the web page in accordance 
with my creativity.
